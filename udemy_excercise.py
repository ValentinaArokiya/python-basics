#STRINGS
# String are not mutable! Can use indexing. But cannot use indexing to change the individual elements of a string.

a = "Hello World"
# a[0] = 'h' --- cannot modify a string once it is assigned. String assignments are immutable.
# print(a)


print(a[8])

b = "tinker"
print(b[1:4])

print("tink"[0:2])


x = "Good Morning"
print(x.upper())

print(x.lower())
print(x.split())
print(x.split('M'))

n = "Hi this is a string"
print(n.split('i'))
