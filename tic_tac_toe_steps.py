# 1. Write a function that can print out a 3x3 board
# # # def display_board()

# 2. Take input from user - to choose marker - X or O
# # # player1 = input("Please pick a marker 'X' or 'O'")

# 3. Take as input - board, marker, position on board - and assign marker to board

# 4. function that takes in a board and a mark (X or O) and then checks to see if that mark has won.
# # # def win_check(board, mark):

# 5. function that uses the random module to randomly decide which player goes first.
# # # def choose_first():

# 6. function that returns a boolean indicating whether a space on the board is freely available.
# # # def space_check(board, position):

# 7. function that checks if the board is full and returns a boolean value. True if full, False otherwise.
# # # def full_board_check(board):

# 8. a function that asks for a player's next position (as a number 1-9) and then uses the function from step 6 to check if it's a free position.
# If it is, then return the position for later use.
# # #

# 9. a function that asks the player if they want to play again and returns a boolean True
